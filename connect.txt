Ever since Django dropped pytz support with its version 4.0, it has been a huge pain to setup mongodb as a backend.

So this a simple guide i decided to make in case someone else is going thru the same thing

- setup a mongodb account for atlas
- create a cluster and then create a user
- give network access ( set it to 0.0.0.0/0 )
- then browse collections and create a db with a collection


- now go to term and create a virtual env and install the following packages(keep in mind that the version numbers ar exactly the same)
asgiref==3.5.0 
Django==4.0.3 
djongo==1.3.6 
dnspython==2.2.1 
pykerberos==1.2.4 
pymongo==3.12.1 
python-snappy==0.6.1 
pytz==2022.1 
sqlparse==0.2.4 

- now create a django website
- and add in the following to its settings.py file 
DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'djongo',
            'NAME': 'your-db-name',
            'ENFORCE_SCHEMA': False,
            'CLIENT': {
                'host': 'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<atlas cluster>/<myFirstDatabase>?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
            }  
        }
}

make changes respectively
the host field has to be replaced by the connection string in the connect tab of ur dashboard
